## Match: WALL·E
```
> **Technical Metadata Traceability**
> [SCHEMA_VALIDATION_START]
> - **KEY:** `title` | **VALUE:** WALL·E
> - **KEY:** `plot`  | **VALUE:** WALL·E is the last robot left on an Earth that has been overrun with garbage and all humans have fled to outer space. For 700 years he has continued to try and clean up the mess, but has developed some rather interesting human-like qualities. When a ship arrives with a sleek new type of robot, WALL·E thinks he's finally found a friend and stows away on the ship when it leaves.

### Narrative Analysis
This film provides a very strong match to the input analysis. The core elements align closely:
- **"A lonely garbage collector robot on a ruined Earth"**: The plot directly states WALL·E is "the last robot left on an Earth that has been overrun with garbage" and describes his 700 years of cleaning, fitting the 'lonely garbage collector' aspect perfectly. The Earth being 'overrun with garbage' clearly establishes it as 'ruined'.
- **"discovers a tiny plant"**: While not explicitly in the provided plot summary, the arrival of a "sleek new type of robot" (EVE) in the film's narrative is directly tied to her mission to find plant life, which WALL·E assists with, making this a canonical match for the film itself, even if not detailed in this specific plot snippet.
- **"sparking a journey across the galaxy"**: WALL·E "stows away on the ship when it leaves," initiating his journey off Earth and into space, which aligns with "sparking a journey across the galaxy."

## Match: Waterworld
```
> **Technical Metadata Traceability**
> [SCHEMA_VALIDATION_START]
> - **KEY:** `title` | **VALUE:** Waterworld
> - **KEY:** `plot`  | **VALUE:** In a futuristic world where the polar ice caps have melted and made Earth a liquid planet, a beautiful barmaid rescues a mutant seafarer from a floating island prison. They escape, along with her young charge, Enola, and sail off aboard his ship. But the trio soon becomes the target of a menacing pirate who covets the map to 'Dryland' – which is tattooed on Enola's back.

```

### Narrative Analysis
This film presents a weak match to the input analysis. While there's a 'ruined Earth' aspect, the specifics diverge significantly:
- **"A lonely garbage collector robot"**: The film features human characters and a "mutant seafarer," not a robot, and there is no garbage collection theme.
- **"on a ruined Earth"**: The concept of a 'ruined Earth' does align, as the planet has become a "liquid planet" due to melted ice caps. However, the nature of the ruin (water vs. garbage) is different.
- **"discovers a tiny plant"**: There is no mention or implied discovery of a tiny plant. The core narrative revolves around a map to 'Dryland'.
- **"sparking a journey across the galaxy"**: The journey is confined to sailing on the Earth's oceans, not "across the galaxy."

## Match: Jupiter Ascending
```
> **Technical Metadata Traceability**
> [SCHEMA_VALIDATION_START]
> - **KEY:** `title` | **VALUE:** Jupiter Ascending
> - **KEY:** `plot`  | **VALUE:** In a universe where human genetic material is the most precious commodity, an impoverished young Earth woman becomes the key to strategic maneuvers and internal strife within a powerful dynasty…
> [SCHEMA_VALIDATION_END]
```

### Narrative Analysis
This film offers a weak match to the input analysis. While it involves space travel, most other key elements are absent:
- **"A lonely garbage collector robot"**: The protagonist is an "impoverished young Earth woman," not a robot, and there is no mention of garbage collection.
- **"on a ruined Earth"**: The Earth is a setting for the protagonist's origin, but it is not described as 'ruined' in the same context as the input (e.g., overrun with garbage).
- **"discovers a tiny plant"**: There is no mention of a plant discovery in the plot summary. The narrative focuses on human genetic material and dynastic struggles.
- **"sparking a journey across the galaxy"**: The film is set "In a universe" and involves "strategic maneuvers" with a "powerful dynasty," which strongly implies space travel and journeys beyond Earth, aligning with the "journey across the galaxy" aspect. However, this is the only significant point of overlap.
