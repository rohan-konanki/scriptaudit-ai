# Script Audit Report

**Analysis of input:** _A detective in a rain-slicked, neon-drenched futuristic city investigates a series of murders committed by 'Shadow-Walkers'—entities that can only exist in the reflections of high-tech billboards. He eventually discovers that the billboards are actually portals to a dark dimension where a megacorporation is harvesting human souls to power a new, 'organic' version of the internet._

## Match: Watchmen

> **Technical Metadata Traceability**
> [SCHEMA_VALIDATION_START]
> - **KEY:** `title` | **VALUE:** Watchmen
> - **KEY:** `plot`  | **VALUE:** In a gritty and alternate 1985 the glory days of costumed vigilantes have been brought to a close by a government crackdown, but after one of the masked veterans is brutally murdered an investigation into the killer is initiated. The reunited heroes set out to prevent their own destruction, but in doing so uncover a sinister plot that puts all of humanity in grave danger.
> [SCHEMA_VALIDATION_END]

### Narrative Analysis
The input shares a **Gritty/Noir Detective** framework with *Watchmen*. Both narratives utilize a specific murder investigation as a "Trojan Horse" to reveal a much larger, systemic conspiracy that threatens the fabric of society. While the input focuses on a technological/supernatural hybrid, the thematic resonance lies in the "uncovering of a sinister plot" involving high-level entities (government in *Watchmen*, megacorporation in the input).

## Match: R.I.P.D.

> **Technical Metadata Traceability**
> [SCHEMA_VALIDATION_START]
> - **KEY:** `title` | **VALUE:** R.I.P.D.
> - **KEY:** `plot`  | **VALUE:** A recently slain cop joins a team of undead police officers working for the Rest in Peace Department and tries to find the man who murdered him. Based on the comic by Peter M. Lenkov.
> [SCHEMA_VALIDATION_END]

### Narrative Analysis
*R.I.P.D.* provides a structural match for the **Metaphysical Law Enforcement** aspect of the input. The concept of "Shadow-Walkers" existing in reflections parallels the "Deadoes" hiding within human society. Both stories involve specialized investigators dealing with entities that bridge the gap between our world and a "darker" or "undead" dimension, though the input leans significantly harder into Cyberpunk aesthetics.

## Match: Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within

> **Technical Metadata Traceability**
> [SCHEMA_VALIDATION_START]
> - **KEY:** `title` | **VALUE:** Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within
> - **KEY:** `plot`  | **VALUE:** Led by a strange dream, scientist Aki Ross struggles to collect the eight spirits in the hope of creating a force powerful enough to protect the planet. With the aid of the Deep Eyes Squadron and her mentor, Dr. Sid, Aki must save the Earth from its darkest hate and unleash the spirits within.
> [SCHEMA_VALIDATION_END]

### Narrative Analysis
The technical and biological intersection of the input—specifically the **harvesting of human souls to power technology**—aligns with the "Gaia" and "Spirit" themes of *Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within*. Both stories involve high-tech sci-fi settings where "souls/spirits" are treated as a quantifiable resource or energy source. The input’s "organic internet" reflects the movie's attempt to reconcile advanced technology with the ethereal/biological nature of the planet's life force.
