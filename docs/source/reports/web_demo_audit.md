## Match: Waterworld

> ```
> [SCHEMA_VALIDATION_START]
> - **KEY:** `title` | **VALUE:** Waterworld
> - **KEY:** `plot`  | **VALUE:** In a futuristic world where the polar ice caps have melted and made Earth a liquid planet, a beautiful barmaid rescues a mutant seafarer from a floating island prison. They escape, along with her young charge, Enola, and sail off aboard his ship. But the trio soon becomes the target of a menacing pirate who covets the map to 'Dryland' – which is tattooed on Enola's back.

> ```

### Narrative Analysis
This film shares thematic elements with your concept regarding an isolated, unique environment (a liquid planet vs. a deep-sea base) and the discovery of something crucial (the map to Dryland vs. a sentient virus). Both narratives center on survival against overwhelming odds and a quest for something unknown or hidden. The "mutant seafarer" could be seen as a distant echo of altered biology, albeit a natural mutation rather than a machine-hybrid transformation. However, the core conflict type differs significantly; *Waterworld* is largely an external human-on-human conflict with a MacGuffin, whereas your idea focuses on an internal, technologically induced biological transformation.

## Match: Independence Day: Resurgence

> ```
> [SCHEMA_VALIDATION_START]
> - **KEY:** `title` | **VALUE:** Independence Day: Resurgence
> - **KEY:** `plot`  | **VALUE:** We always knew they were coming back. Using recovered alien technology, the nations of Earth have collaborated on an immense defense program to protect the planet. But nothing can prepare us for the aliens’ advanced and unprecedented force. Only the ingenuity of a few brave men and women can bring our world back from the brink of extinction.
> [SCHEMA_VALIDATION_END]
> ```

### Narrative Analysis
This match relates to your concept through the theme of humanity confronting an advanced, overwhelming, and unprecedented force. The "aliens' advanced and unprecedented force" parallels the unexpected power of your "ancient, sentient computer virus." Both scenarios present a high-stakes struggle for survival, requiring ingenuity from a small group to avert disaster. The use of advanced technology (recovered alien tech vs. deep-sea research tech) also provides a point of connection. However, the nature of the threat (external alien invasion vs. internal technological virus) and its specific impact (global destruction vs. biological transformation) are distinct.

## Match: Transformers: Age of Extinction

> ```
> [SCHEMA_VALIDATION_START]
> - **KEY:** `title` | **VALUE:** Transformers: Age of Extinction
> - **KEY:** `plot`  | **VALUE:** As humanity picks up the pieces, following the conclusion of "Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Autobots and Decepticons have all but vanished from the face of the planet. However, a group of powerful, ingenious businessman and scientists attempt to learn from past Transformer incursions and push the boundaries of technology beyond what they can control - all while an ancient, powerful Transformer menace sets Earth in his cross-hairs.
> [SCHEMA_VALIDATION_END]
> ```

### Narrative Analysis
This film offers the strongest conceptual alignment with your input idea. The premise of "ingenious businessmen and scientists attempt to learn from past Transformer incursions and push the boundaries of technology beyond what they can control" directly echoes the inherent danger of deep-sea researchers discovering and interacting with an ancient, sentient computer virus. More critically, the central theme of "Transformers" as sentient machines, and the concept of "reconstructing" people into "machine-hybrid servants," finds a powerful parallel in the very nature of these transforming, intelligent entities. The idea of an "ancient, powerful menace" setting its sights on Earth is comparable to the virus's methodical 'auditing' and transformation of the researchers.
